	   <section class="aboutsection_order">  
		<p id= "secondtext"> Code Camp was founded in 2014, based on Jonathan’s successful experiences in teaching young children to code through playful activities. Today, at Code Camp, we are bringing fun, knowledge and opportunity into the lives of thousands of learners around the world. </br>
		CodeCamp was born out of a desire to fill a need in education, a need to provide a true, comprehensive technology education in a fun, stress-free environment. Our STEM focused courses and tech camps provide the basis for a much deeper education in technology than what students receive at their schools. This is because our instructors are all both industry tested STEM and computer programming professionals, and because these instructors have gained a wealth of teaching experience to kids in STEM, Technology, and Coding in various formats. </br>

Most importantly, we partner with families to provide children with a safe and encouraging environment to gain the skills they need for a brighter future. </br> We look forward to earning your trust. </br>
		At CodeCamp we are passionate about community. CodeCamp publish their work on the CodeCamp community forum where they can collaborate with the peer coders and give and receive feedback.

		Learning how to think and problem solve is where the real value of Code Ninjas lives. But it's not only about teaching children to be problem solvers. For our franchise owners, we solve the problem of finally realizing a meaningful career path that positively impacts their communities. </br>
		Our Tech/Coding classes and camps are all project-based, which means students are applying computational thinking to each coding skill they learn, and are using the highest level processing skills as identified by the Common Core for true comprehension of the material they are learning to use and apply.
