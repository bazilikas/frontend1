		<h2>Creativity, Technology & Learning Through Play – Don’t Learn to Code – Code to Learn	</h2>
        <p>JUN 20, 2018</p>
		<img src="images/blog10.jpg" alt="screen"/>
        <p>With the sheer volume of information, rumour and hearsay regarding the use of technology by kids. It is little wonder why many parents struggle to know what their kids should or should not be using to learn code and for how long to reap the educational benefits and avoid the negatives.</p>
        <p>It is normal for kids to have screen time (TV, Laptop, Smart Phone, iPad e.t.c.) limited. It seems every generation has had their distractions that threatened their futures and each generation has realised that it is all about finding a balance.</p>
        <p>The way that we interact and engage with each other is heavily invaded by digital tools and that is only likely to increase. There is no avoiding it. There is no reason that this should be a negative. In the future your kids will be involved with technology in almost every role they pursue in their future careers. It is likely that those roles do not even exist yet and the specific technologies they will be using almost certainly do not exist yet, such is the speed of change.</p>
        <p>So as a parent can we find a way of nurturing an interest and understanding of what the benefits of technology are? Can we nurture an interest in technology and science that will keep them safely curious, enthusiastic and give them a solid foundation to build on?</p>
        <p>Here are some key points to consider to take the technology they love and instead of just using it, start to understand how to make it.</p>        
        <p> Don’t just play video games, make them. Playing games is fun. The UK is now a multigenerational population of gamers. When age appropriate and balanced, video games can reinforce problem solving skills, creative thinking and other key ingredients to a child’s development. If you take that passion for playing (video games) and nurture a desire to create them you give purpose to learning to make technology. You are coding to learn not learning to code. There are multiple resources out there that can get your kid learning to code that we’ll outline below.</p>
		<p>Don’t jump straight to the Laptop. Technology provides an amazing “canvas” to be creative with. It is however just another canvass and should not exclude pens, paper, crayons and some good old gluing and sticking. Before diving onto the keyboard, draw out a plan. Include the characters (heroes and villains), objects, scoring, backgrounds, levels, story and mission. This will multiply the learning, enjoyment and give a greater desire to persist through the tricky process of putting all this together with the needed code.</p>
        <p>Planning is a key skill in programming. It is not unusual to hear kids say they are bored with one piece of technology or another – or that they “know it” and want the next cool thing. Quite often what they are saying is they do not know what to do next or cannot get it to do what they want. A great way to remove this modern day writers block is to make the plan before trying to write the code (a valuable skill in it’s own right).
        Do not rush to real code. There are many stories we hear about a kid who has created an amazing piece of technology using real development tools. Many parents look to encourage their kids to take on a full programming language too early. There is no need to get bogged down in the syntax of getting real code right. Instead focus on developing the logical thinking, creative thinking and planning to create projects in tools like Scratch. There will be plenty of time to get to grips with the real code once an interest and enthusiasm has been nurtured.</p>
		<p>Play – Make it fun. Learning happens naturally when kids are playing. Obstacles to learning disappear when kids are trying to do something they are vested in and enjoy. Do not be concerned that a project never gets completed or that things did not turn out as were planned. Just be supportive and be involved, interested and encouraging. Creating technology is not easy, the answers not always obvious and considerable persistence is required to overcome setbacks and problems. All sound like valuable life lessons?</p>
